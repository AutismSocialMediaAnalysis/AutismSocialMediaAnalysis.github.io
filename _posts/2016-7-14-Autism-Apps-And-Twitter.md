There are multiple startups and grassroots efforts involved with creating autism app solutions.  Twitter can serve as a great source of information related to autism app trends.  Recent examples include:

* [A presentation using Skoog—an accessible music interface for iPad—](https://concierge.apple.com/events/R251/adam-goldberg/6153603276446538247/en_US)featuring a band of special needs students.

* A story about how an autistic teen [used an iPad to let his voice be heard.](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/short-films-show-how-teen-with-autism-uses-ipad-to-make-voice-heard_us_5703fedde4b0daf53af123d9)

* An app [that may allow an autistic child to become more independent.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bVgPqsKpvg&index=5&list=PL-LivWbVIcqAbpyO2u29Dddn0H9GeUp8O)

In future posts, we will examine autism app trends and content in greater detail.
