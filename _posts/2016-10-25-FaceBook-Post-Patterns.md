title: Posting Patterns of Facebook Accounts      
---

In a previous blog post, we graphed the posting patterns of the Twitter accounts associated with the autism app companies which we are monitoring. A natural extension of that analysis is to examine the FaceBook posting patterns of the same companies.

Some companies used Twitter to post nearly every day.  Does the same thing happen with FaceBook posts, or are the two platforms used differently?

The following heatmap shows the FaceBook posting frequency since September 1, 2016 of the accounts that we are tracking.  Accounts that have not posted anything since September 1st are not included in the chart.

The chart illustrates that, similar to Twitter, some accounts to post to FaceBook every (or nearly every) day.  Examples include Autism Village and Rufus Robot.

In our next blog post, we'll compare posting patterns between FaceBook and Twitter for the same account.  Are the accounts that post frequently in one platform the same accounts that post frequently in the other?  Are there accounts that only use one platform, not posting to the other?
