title: Posting Patterns of Twitter Accounts      
---

We have been tracking the Twitter and Facebook activity of a group of companies providing autism solution apps.  We have identified 100 Twitter accounts, but all accounts have not actively posted to Twitter in 2016.  

Of those that have posted, there is significant variation in the frequency of Twitter usage. Some accounts post something to Twitter nearly every day.  Other accounts use Twitter infrequently. 

The following heatmap shows the Twitter posting frequency since September 1, 2016 of the accounts that we are tracking.  Accounts that have not posted anything since September 1st are not included in the chart.
