title: Facebook Autism Public Pages (Part 2)      
---

Querying the FaceBook Graph API in June for public pages containing words related to autism resulted in the identification of 1200 Facebook pages.  Running the same query a month later returned 1500 Facebook pages. The following table summarizes the pages contained in the June and in the July queries. 

Outcome| Number of Pages
--- | ---:
In June and July lists | 1091
In July list only | 523
In June list only | 198


Interestingly, some of the pages identified in the June query but not in the July query contained recent posts.  In other words, these were not inactive pages that were dropped by the Facebook search.  This suggests an approach of periodically querying the Facebook API for autism related public pages, and adding to the list over time.  A small number of pages (10) contained in the page list generated in June returned an error when using the API during the following month.  These pages would be candidates for removal from our list of Autism related Facebook pages.


Extracting information from the Facebook pages requires not only identifying the pages, but also downloading posts over time.  A subset of the identified Facebook pages may not contain any recent posts and may not be actively maintained pages.  The following table summarizes the posts downloaded from June 14 to July 23, using the list of Facebook autism pages generated on June 14 (1200 pages).

Outcome| Number of Pages
--- | ---:
Identified pages with posts | 670
Identified pages wihout posts | 590
Posts from unidentified pages | 2800

53% of the autism Facebook pages contained at least one post during the time period, which means that a substantial number of pages (590) have not had any recent activity.  However, the search query did return a substantial number of posts from pages that were not initially identified as autism-related pages.  These may be pages that do not contain an autism related keyword in the page name, but contribute posts to autism pages. If the Facebook pages associated with these contributors are public, they can be added to the list of autism-related pages.  If their pages are private, it is at least possible to download their autism-related posts to the public autism pages.
