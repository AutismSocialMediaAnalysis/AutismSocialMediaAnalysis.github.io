title: Autism Apps      
---

There is a growing list of companies and entrepeneurs who are focused on improving the lives of people with autism, their families, and their care givers. Some have developed computer, web, mobile device, and robotic software and technology solutions for the challenges associated with autism. We have begun to track the social media presence of a set of companies providing electronic (tech) solutions for autism. We have focused on tech companies providing autism specific apps and not non-tech companies who may have created an autism app. Specifically, we have examined the Twitter presence of 100 companies having twitter accounts. We also examine the presense on FaceBook for 87 of these companies that also have public FaceBook pages. 

Twitter provides several metrics that convey information about accounts' connections and influence across the social media platform. Accounts with more followers are able to share information more easily across the Twitter network. The number of posts by an account indicates how active an account is in using Twitter to share information. And, the number of posts 'liked' by other accounts reveals sentiment toward the account posts.

It is informative to examine the number of followers, posts and 'likes' as of August 2016. In order to identify recent momentum in developing a presence on Twitter, we also examine the change in followers, posts and likes between August and July 2016.

The following table lists the companies with the top 5 followers, posts and 'likes' as of August 2016.
